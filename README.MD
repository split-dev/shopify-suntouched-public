Custom Shopify Development for Suntouched

Project Background: We embarked on a creative journey with our client from Canada to develop ‘Suntouched’, a website dedicated to celebrating blonde, salty sea-touched hair. Our client’s vision was to offer a line of hair lightening sprays and masks that reflect a pure and innovative approach.

Challenges and Solutions: The original site was built using a basic site builder, which limited functionality and design options. Recognizing the need for a unique user experience, we conducted an initial audit by our SEO specialist to tailor our strategy effectively. We then proceeded to design a custom Shopify theme from scratch, ensuring a sleek, responsive, and accessible website for all users, including those with disabilities.

Technical Implementation: The new site was developed on Shopify 2.0, integrating the latest web technologies to enhance user interaction and site performance. Our focus on modern, minimalistic design not only appeals aesthetically but also supports better navigation and user engagement.

Impact and Results: Post-launch, Suntouched has not only attracted a significant increase in site visitors but also dramatically improved client acquisition. The site’s intuitive design and minimalistic aesthetics received overwhelmingly positive feedback. Most notably, Charlotte, the store owner, reported a remarkable 45% increase in conversion rates shortly after the site went live.
